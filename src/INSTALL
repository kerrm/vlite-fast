Package depedencies:

Relies on
 -- heimdall [sourceforge fork of heimdall (gilgalad55)]
 -- dedisp [github fork of dedisp (gilgalad55)]
 -- vdifio [from Paul Demorest's github]
 -- psrdada [from sourceforge]
 -- cuda

 Reliance on heimdall and dedisp is simply through command line, so they
 can be installed anywhere so long as they are in the path.

 NB that in heimdall installation, it is good to set CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS as an
 environment variable to get the correct gencode settings.  (See
 src/Makefile for settings appropriate for the VLITE-Fast GPUs.)
 
 The default Makefile will work if libraries and headers for vdifio and
 psrdada are available in the location referred to by PACKAGE_DIR, update
 Makefile as appropriate.

 Update CUDA directory in Makefile.
